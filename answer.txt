African immigration to the United States refers to immigrants to the United States who are or were nationals of Africa .
The term African in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national origins rather than racial affiliation .
From the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to 2007 , an estimated total of 0.8 to 0.9 million Africans immigrated to the United States , accounting for roughly 3.3 % of total immigration to the United States during this period .
African immigrants in the United States come from almost all regions in Africa and do not constitute a homogeneous group .
They include people from different national , linguistic , ethnic , racial , cultural and social backgrounds .
As such , African immigrants are to be distinguished from African American people , the latter of whom are descendants of mostly West and Central Africans who were involuntarily brought to the United States by means of the historic Atlantic slave trade .
